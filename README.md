# eventmanager

## Abstract

### Overview

The goal of EventManager is to provide a Open Source alternative to machine logging and data collecting solutions.
Users will be able to submit data, events and information that they wish to log on the system, whether embedded in their own solution's code or through any device that can send HTTP requests.

### Backend

The backend utilises a JSON driven REST API built on node.js. It allows the user to submit and retrieve data via HTTP methods.
